# meepspeak
A plugin that changes NPC/item/widget names to "meepspeak" in the following:

- Official OSRS health bar (Chambers of Xeric, Inferno, etc)
- Menu option (right-click)
- Theatre of Blood widgets
- Combat Achievements/Collection Log interface (CA not fully working yet)

**Note: This was created for entertainment purposes only and provides no benefits when used.**

Big thank you to [Nick Ints](https://github.com/InfernoStats) and [Aurelify](https://github.com/tdb48) for doing basically all of the work ðŸ™‚
