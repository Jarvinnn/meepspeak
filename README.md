# meepspeak
Simple plugin that changes NPC/item/widget names to "meepspeak" in the following:
- Official OSRS Health bar (CoX, Inferno, etc)
- Menu option (right-click)
- ToB widgets

Big thank you to [Aurelify](https://github.com/tdb48) and [Nick | Int](https://github.com/InfernoStats) for doing basically all of the work ðŸ™‚
